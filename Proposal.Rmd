#Add 1 paragraph describing your data set and 1 paragraph outlining your proposed in-class and out-of-class methods.

The Dialect Survey uses a series of questions, including rhyming word pairs and vocabulary words, to explore the distribution of dialects in Americain. We have 122 survey responses from 47,472 people from different city, state and zip code areas.  

In this project, we would use these data to fit a KNN classification model showing predicted class membership at each location in the US based on dialect. Our explanatory variable is zipcode and response is dialect. In addition, our second analysis will be based on a topic we haven't learned in class such as, neural networks to help us cluster, classify and recognize patterns of the data.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
